  <h1 style="font-size:40px;">About Me</h1>
    <p style="font-size:24px;"> Hello there! My name is Maria Milekhina and I'm a girl who codes. I decided to learn coding this summer because I'm curious and like trying new things. My favorite subjects in school are History, English, and Foreign Language (I'm studying French and Spanish). I live in Brooklyn with my mom, dad, and eleven year old brother. </p>

    <p style="font-size:24px;">This game, created using Scratch, is called "The Adventures of the Amazing Tampon." The premise is that you have to help the tampon jump over any obstacles to get the girl in time. We were inspired by other girls who code that created the game "Tampon Run." </p>

    <h6> Journal Entry: July 12, first day of Python </h6>
    <p6> Both Scratch and Python have the pen function (pen up, pen down) and the ability to draw shapes. This allows for the shapes to then change in color, and for the pen to have different thickness, to account for angular motion, and to move certain lengths. Also, Scratch and Python both have the ability to create loops. Â Some differences between Python and Scratch is that Python works by typing lines of code, using elements like integers and floats, colons and parentheses. Scratch is a more visual way to program, using drag and drop to input lines of code. Python runs on a computer through a Terminal/Command Prompt, whereas Scratch runs on the Web. Debugging my program today was one of the many challenges I faced being introduced to Python for the first time. It was fun for me to try different lines of code and see how the Turtle would draw them. Any time I saw an error message, I had to see what was wrong in my program. Sometimes my error was as minor as forgetting a colon, other times it was using a word. Overall, I enjoyed the problem-solving and overcoming obstacles along the way to create a program that worked. </p6>
